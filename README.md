# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course (Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer)


## Summary
The tool provides a quick evaluation of the review, helping users understand the general sentiment of the text. It is designed to be simple and efficient, allowing anyone to quickly determine if a movie is well-received or not based on the review content.

## Background
Problem 1: People often spend a lot of time reading multiple movie reviews to decide whether a film is worth watching.
Problem 2: Reviews may be written in slang, sarcasm, or mixed sentiment, making it hard to judge the overall opinion manually.

## How is it used?
Casual movie watchers: Need quick guidance on whether a film is worth their time.
Film enthusiasts and bloggers: Want to analyze trends in reviews and understand audience sentiment.
Researchers or students: Need to process large volumes of reviews efficiently.

## Example Usage
The complete Python code is available in the file `movie_sentiment.py` in this repository. Click on it to view or download it.

## Data sources and AI methods
| Data source | All data is collected manually by me from movie reviews, so the program works completely offline. No external APIs or online connections are needed.|
| AI method   | The program uses a natural language processing (NLP) model to analyze the sentiment of the review. It classifies reviews as positive or negative based on keywords, phrases, and overall context|      

## Challenges
The program cannot perfectly interpret very short reviews because it lacks enough context; extremely brief reviews may be classified as neutral even if they are clearly positive or negative.

## What next?

The program could evolve into a more advanced sentiment analysis tool that handles sarcasm, irony, and nuanced language.
